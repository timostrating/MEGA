# MEGA
MEGA is my attempt to collect and analyze as much of my personal information as possible for a year. All scripts I write to automate actions will be stored in this repo. I like to expend this repo in the future with a way to visualize what I am learning. A learning tracking system of some sort of kind.

Currently, I am also searching for a better way to store lecture notes. I stopped using Evernote. Just a piece of paper still works the best for me.

## Time registration
I registered what I do every 30 minutes from the start to the end of the year.

## Weekly planning
I keep track of what I want to do every week. This is also the place where I can see in a glance what is coming up in the next weeks. 

I stopped doing this after a few months. This way of making visible what I was doing did not really help and only made it so this ended more like a place where there was visible what I did in stead of what I had for the upcoming weeks.<p align="center">

## Unofficial joined classes at a local university
There is a really nice university a few cities down the road, so I am joining some classes unofficially there.

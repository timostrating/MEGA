The Winter School takes a multidisciplinary approach to the theme, intertwining philosophical, legal, economic, psychological and sociological perspectives to the issues. These issues will be addressed by a mixture of lectures, workshops and discussion sessions. The Winter School will provide all participants with a thought-provoking view on Academic Freedom and all matters involved with it. Participants will have the opportunity to work on case studies and identify action points to effectively contribute to enhancing Academic Freedom. Together with their team and coach, participants will choose a project in order to solve a specific problem and prepare an action plans in order to actively contribute to enhancing Academic Freedom.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><table class="userTable zebra"><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Faculteit</td><td colspan="2">Honours College</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Voertaal</td><td colspan="2">Engels</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Coordinator</td><td colspan="2"><a href="/ocasys/rug/vak/viewtutor?tutor=10934">mr.

Over the last three or four centuries, the Western part of the world has adopted a tradition in which the development of societies is largely dependent on political institutions. It has been argued that this tradition inevitably leads to liberal democracy as the dominant model. Right across historical and political developments, a set of dilemmas or challenges keeps popping up. These dilemmas are topics of constitutional law and they are characteristic of most, if not all democratic societies. Differences of an economical, sociological and political nature determined the way in which these challenges have been faced. In spite of these differences, there is commonality to the political responses to these dilemmas and challenges.<br/><br/>An important question for today is whether the choices for constructing a political society that were made in the past are sustainable for the days to come. Political authority is, due to several developments, becoming less and less self-evident. On a micro level, communities have chosen alternative mechanisms to organize and arrange themselves. On a macro level, ongoing globalization and especially Europeanization puts the statehood of the Member States in a whole new perspective. Moreover, the European Union itself is continuously faced with dilemmas and challenges that its Member States have responded to, earlier on.<br/><br/>The broadening module “Constructing a polity - five features of transitional democracies” sets out to discuss the aforementioned dilemmas and the traditional responses thereto. During the Summer School, these issues will be explored by visiting a state that has undergone several transitions, in all of which the dilemmas and challenges became apparent: Poland. In medieval times, the Polish empire was the largest in Europe. In 1791, the Polish Commonwealth enacted the first modern Constitution on the European continent. Only a few years later, however, the so-called Polish partitions led to the complete dissolution of the Polish Commonwealth as an independent state. It was only after the First World War that Poland reappeared as a sovereign state. This was not the end of the Polish constitutional drama, however. The country disappeared from the map in the Second World War and returned afterwards – but only as a satellite of the Soviet Union. After the fall of communism, and especially after the accession to the European Union in 2004, the Polish constitutional structure underwent yet another transition that gave cause to dilemmas old and new. During the summer school we will study the way in which Poland has dealt with, and keeps dealing with these dilemma's. This enquiry could not be more current, as the Polish struggle between democracy, politics and constitutional law is the topic of many a news item today.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><table class="userTable zebra"><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Faculteit</td><td colspan="2">Honours College</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Voertaal</td><td colspan="2">Engels</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Coordinator</td><td colspan="2"><a href="/ocasys/rug/vak/viewtutor?tutor=1357">mr.

Whilst on location, students will explore dimensions of diversity and inclusion in the (third) most liveable city of the world, i.e Vancouver. <br/><br/>Our key aim will be to provide a multi-dimensional and critical perspective on the inclusiveness of the city for marginalized groups. In so doing, we will compare and contrast the findings from our Groningen research. Preparation for the summer school includes reading literature on issues of city planning, diversity, inclusion and marginalization in Vancouver, and writing a research plan for the group project.<br/><br/>After a city walk led by the director of the City Program at Simon Fraser University our week will include input on various aspects of the topic by a variety of researchers based at  Simon Fraser University and the University of British Columbia.<br/><br/>Other  important parts of the summer school will be an individual assignment (tba)and a group project. The group project consist of fieldwork that will be carried out to gain perspectives of people living in Vancouver,  and students will therefore need to approach people and organisations for interviews. Students will also collect visual data. Preliminary results of the student projects will be presented on the last day during a hike in the forest.<br/><br/>The summer school will include an assessment of the individual assignments, the research plan, the project presentations, and the development of a public product (Petrus Camper Festival).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><table class="userTable zebra"><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Faculteit</td><td colspan="2">Honours College</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Voertaal</td><td colspan="2">Engels</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Coordinator</td><td colspan="2"><a href="/ocasys/rug/vak/viewtutor?tutor=1630">dr.

For a long time, the gas extraction generated a lot of revenues for the Dutch state. The population in Groningen was proud of the gas extraction and that it contributed to the growing wealth of the Netherlands. However, the first negative consequences of the gas extraction started to be revealed since the 1980s when the first signs of ground movement were observed. Whereas the relationship between the gas extraction and ground movement was denied for a many years, the influence of the gas extraction on the soil was acknowledged when the first signs of soil subsidence came to the fore. In the years that followed, earthquakes were observed which were also a result of the decreasing pressure in the earth due to the gas extraction. From the 1990s until 2012, the earthquakes were of a low magnitude and caused mainly problems with regard to damage and cracks in walls of houses and buildings. However, this changed in August 2012 when an earthquake hit near the village of Huizinge. This earthquake, with a magnitude of 3.6 on the Richter scale, marks a big change in the earthquake and gas extraction issues, as this was no longer limited to damage issues, but extended to safety matters of the population.<br/><br/>In order to deal in an adequate way with the problems, several institutions are installed to coordinate the actions of the different local tiers of government and to conduct damage assessments. Yet, the Dutch state is very much interwoven with the private company that extracts the gas from the soil. These public-private sector interrelationships make the governance system for dealing with and solving the issues highly complex. These characteristics of the earthquakes have a big influence on the social acceptance and impact, the mental wellbeing of the population, the decreasing housing and real estate values of the properties in the area, and governance approach to deal with the earthquake issues.<br/><br/>In this Summer School we dive deeper into these complex problems. Students will actively engage with the issues by a simulation game. The students will be split up in groups of different stakeholders in this issue. For example, one group represents the private gas extraction company, one group represents the national government, one group represents affected citizens, one group represents the media, etc. The general assignment for the week is: to work together to find a fitting solution for the issues in Groningen. <br/><br/>To reach a better understanding of the interests of the different parties involved, we will organize several activities in the Province of Groningen. For example, we will visit damaged houses and monuments. We will talk to activists, public officials, representatives of the government and civil society organizations working on the gas extraction issues. At the end of the week, students will have a good comprehension of the core of the problems and be able to take in a nuanced standpoint on the matter.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><table class="userTable zebra"><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Faculteit</td><td colspan="2">Honours College</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Voertaal</td><td colspan="2">Engels</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Coordinator</td><td colspan="2"><a href="/ocasys/rug/vak/viewtutor?tutor=12593"> M.M.

The programme is open for law students and a limited number of students from other faculties.<br/><br/>The research  is titled ‘Energy Law in a Changing World: Technological and Legal Innovations’. Realizing the global commitment to reduce carbon emissions, which has recently been reaffirmed in the Paris Agreement, requires a vast amount of innovative technologies and solutions to be integrated into the global energy system. The integration of such technologies and solutions also requires their acknowledgement in legislation, assigning roles and responsibilities to all parties involved. Issues to be discussed involve innovative topics such as prosumers and smart grids, hydrogen, biogas, re-use of installations, e-storage.<br/><br/>The research focuses on these developments from a EU (Dutch) and US perspective and will be organized in the following way:<br/>• In the period February – May the students will be involved in a teaching program (broadening module), which aims at familiarizing the students with the legal issues involved. <br/>• Each student will be required to examine in detail one of the above issues in order to be prepared for the RUG summer school. <br/>• In August 2018 the RUG and GW students will meet in Washington. During this week the students will be divided in groups consisting of GW and RUG students. Each group will focus on one of the above topics and present the preliminary outcome of their research at the end of that week. <br/>• Thereafter the Dutch and US students will turn their papers into an article. These papers will be finalized and presented  in Groningen during Spring 2019. <br/>• Published articles will be presented at the Petrus Camper Festival in June 2019.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><table class="userTable zebra"><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Faculteit</td><td colspan="2">Honours College</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Voertaal</td><td colspan="2">Engels</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Coordinator</td><td colspan="2"><a href="/ocasys/rug/vak/viewtutor?tutor=1507">prof. mr. dr.

This course consists of a discovery journey through the physics of the very small and the very large, from elementary particles and strings, through the molecular world at nanoscale dimensions, and through the world of genes and biodiversity to galaxies and the universe.<br/><br/>The Summer School consists of five topical days with interactive lectures, discussions, workshops  and evening presentations in Geneva (Switzerland). Forefront scientific research topics and their ethical and societal impact will be discussed. <br/><br/>In Geneva we will visit CERN (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire).<br/>At CERN we will learn about fundamental research and see inside the world’s largest particle physics laboratory. You will hear, first hand, about exciting physics and related disciplines,  and you will see the enormous scale of the enterprise. Unless you see it you will not fully appreciate the magnitude of the task and the achievement.<br/><br/>Particle Physics is about answering some of the ‘big questions’ in science. What are the basic building blocks of matter? How did the Universe begin? CERN is one of the places where we may find some of the answers. During our visit we might include one of the LHC experiment controls rooms, the magnet assembly hall or even a chance to see one of the experiments itself, 100m underground (it depends on what is available at the time of your visit). We may also be able to visit the antimatter factory, the computer center which handles data from the LHC or the Proton Synchrotron at the heart of the CERN accelerator complex. <br/><br/>Next to CERN we will also visit one or two other international organizations based in Geneva.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><table class="userTable zebra"><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Faculteit</td><td colspan="2">Honours College</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Voertaal</td><td colspan="2">Engels</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Coordinator</td><td colspan="2"><a href="/ocasys/rug/vak/viewtutor?tutor=2846">dr.

During a visit to England (Cambridge and/or London) the subject will be introduced by several experts in the field from ancient history towards more recent. Among others, the themes to be discussed could be promotion and thoughts about fertility and birth control, the social diversity of reproduction, communication about reproduction, the development of technologies and the regulations that come with those new developments.<br/>During the Atelier, small interdisciplinary groups of students will work on one of the subjects presented during the Winter School. During the Atelier several meetings will be planned. <br/><br/>1) Students learn how to approach a problem relevant to science and society from different perspectives and develop their own approach to it, with vision and an eye to the future. At the same time, you develop a range of skills, and attention is paid to your personal development.<br/>2) Students will gain knowledge in the field of human reproduction.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><table class="userTable zebra"><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Faculteit</td><td colspan="2">Honours College</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Voertaal</td><td colspan="2">Engels</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Docent(en)</td><td colspan="2"><a href="/ocasys/rug/vak/viewtutor?tutor=2655">dr.

Students will gain knowledge on relevant theories and methodologies from workshops given by these scholars, focused on the relationship between religion and the public domain in a variety of different cultural, political, social, economic and historical contexts. A select number of advanced Portuguese students with an interest in the subject will also be participating. In addition, students will conduct their own field research during the summer school, led by an expert on ethnographic fieldwork. During the atelier meetings following on from this summer school, students will work in groups to conduct research on a topic related to religion in the public domain of their choosing.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><table class="userTable zebra"><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Faculteit</td><td colspan="2">Honours College</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Voertaal</td><td colspan="2">Engels</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Coordinator</td><td colspan="2"><a href="/ocasys/rug/vak/viewtutor?tutor=4906">dr.

Exploring a variety of artifacts taken from Rome’s rich depository of cultural layers (from works of art and texts to buildings, and from prehistoric times to 21st century), we will study the ways in which these artifacts were imagined, created and used in the course of history to deal with questions and problems facing society. We will thus have the opportunity to discuss and reflect upon some of the main issues raised by contemporary theories of cultural evolution. Each student (or group of students) will be free to focus on a specific historical period or genre (or combination of genres). The unity of the course is guaranteed by the shared theoretical and methodological framework.

He, and others before him, are accused of ‘fact-free politics’.  Supposed remedy: let the facts speak again. See the popularity of fact-checkers. But is it that simple? Do scientific, objective facts speak for themselves – separated from political, subjective values? Or are science and politics much more intertwined than this traditional answer suggests?  See discussions about, e.g., climate change, medical treatments, or economic models. Where science ends and politics begins? Should policy decisions be based on scientific knowledge or on political ideals? Or, may be, on a mix of both? And if so, what are the implications for the relation between scientific experts, politicians and citizens? For the relation between science and democracy? Who is allowed to talk when about what? And what about the role of intermediaries between science and politics: applied researchers, governmental officials, policy advisors, journalists, spin-docters, consultants, communication officers, etc.?<br/><br/>To get acquainted in real practice with the complex relations between science and politics, we go to the place where – in the Netherlands – both meet each other par excellence: The Hague. Here we find not only the national parliament (including Nieuwspoort – the centre where journalists and politicians meet each other ), but also several policy advise institutes – like the Scientific Council for Government Policy,  the Health Council, the Education Council, the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, etc. We will visit some of these institutions and their representatives – including (members of) the parliament.<br/><br/>Atelier:<br/>In the atelier students will select and analyze case-studies, exemplary for the entanglement of science and politics. The cases can be Dutch, but, especially for non-Dutch participants, also from abroad – making an international comparison possible.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><table class="userTable zebra"><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Faculteit</td><td colspan="2">Honours College</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Voertaal</td><td colspan="2">Engels</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Coordinator</td><td colspan="2"><a href="/ocasys/rug/vak/viewtutor?tutor=1227">dr.

The following days of the summer school you will develop a research proposal to address the sustainability issue in small groups. You will learn how to define the social aspects of the problem and how to develop strategies to solve the problem, supervised and guided by experienced researchers from the Netherlands and Switzerland. In addition, lectures will be given by experts in the field. On the final day of the summer school the groups will present their proposal to the Swiss organization and fellow students.

The local community exists of 10.000 Marrons. They fled from their slave masters and built their own society. They have their own local language, Sarramacan. Most of the Marrons still live a traditional life with their animistic religion and rituals. Many man en young adults leave those villages and move to Paramaribo or French Guyana. The woman, taking also care for the children and elderly, stay behind but also go to their agricultural plot deep inside the jungle. During those times the young daughters are left behind to take over their mothers duties and therefore cannot go to school. To improve the care for the elderly a healthcare project was started. Also local day care for the youngest children was organized enabling the girls to go to school.<br/><br/>During the Summer school we will visit Parimaribo and the Danpaati River Logde to gain insight in the local organization of health care. During our visit at Danpaati we have the opportunity to directly speak to the local population and see the local healthcare and daycare projects from the inside.<br/><br/>From the students it  is expected to prepare at least one activity in the “Mediatheek” to bring to the children or elderly of the surrounding villages. This activity will be prepared within the connected broadening module. Within this broadening module also a theoretical background will be provided during several meetings with specialists from the fields of healthcare organization, intercultural communication, education, etc.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><table class="userTable zebra"><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Faculteit</td><td colspan="2">Honours College</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Voertaal</td><td colspan="2">Nederlands</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Coordinator</td><td colspan="2"><a href="/ocasys/rug/vak/viewtutor?tutor=2655">dr.

Whereas many people know the islands, only those who sail there really experience the magic of the largest sea that falls dry twice a day.<br/><br/>The Dutch Waddenislands aim for energy independency from the mainland by 2020. Whereas different technological options are being considered to realize this, one of the main hurdles is the support of the population and tourists for these plans. How to make people enthusiastic and willing to contribute to solar power farms, windmills, and perhaps electrical vehicles and smart grid technology? Technology is often well developed, and economically many options are viable, yet it is often hard to reach a social tipping point where people switch from waiting to action. In the Summer School we will focus on this question, which is relevant for the energy transition in general.<br/><br/>The Summer School will take place from August 26th (depart around 18:00) – August 31st (arrival around 17:00), and will be situated on the clipper Willem Jacob (and if necessary a second ship). On this beautiful, fast and green key certified clipper built in 1889, we will sail from Harlingen to Terschelling, Ameland, and Schiermonnikoog to arrive at Lauwersoog. On the islands, and at the dry-falling Waddenseas, we will discuss sustainability with a variety of interesting people from the islands, not only emphasizing a technical view, but also interesting narratives and artistic approaches that contribute to the shaping of a sustainable future. This is expected to give a much deeper insight in the complexities and opportunities of growing towards a sustainable society in general. Also, it will help us to define a research question for the connected Atelier afterwards, in which answers will be sought for that are relevant for the Islands and the world in general in reaching for sustainability. Important is that we start thinking about long-term perspectives, something that will be emphasized by my story about the history of the region, and the technical and social developments that happened during the last 50 years.<br/><br/>The sailing will serve as a natural metaphor for managing complex systems. Whereas we have a very experienced captain, shipmate and not to forget a great cook, you are expected to work aboard as well. You will learn about maneuvering such a large ship and navigating it though the wonderful tidal zone of the Waddensea, which is World Heritage. You will experience a walk on the sea bottom, swim in the middle of nature and encounter many seals. One day we’ll sleep in the midst of the sea on anchor, the next day we stay in the cozy harbor of Terschelling, and obviously we will have a dance party at the Tox bar on Schiermonnikoog.<br/><br/>Being an interdisciplinary scientists myself, originating from social psychology, but very much into complexity science, and also fond of natural sciences, I hope to share a lot of my knowledge, experiences and doubts with you in vivid discussions. Also I’m sailing a lot on the Waddensea myself, and am therefore very familiar with the history and interesting aspects of the different islands.<br/><br/>Living on this ship together for a week is a unique experience, and I’m sure we will discuss a lot about science in general, life and nature. I also hope to inspire you with out-of-the-box thinking, interdisciplinary thinking and making science fun.<br/>The maximum number of students is limited to 25, so don’t hesitate too long. <br/><br/>Welcome aboard!</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><table class="userTable zebra"><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Faculteit</td><td colspan="2">Honours College</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Voertaal</td><td colspan="2">Engels</td></tr><tr><td class="fieldLabel">Docent(en)</td><td colspan="2"><a href="/ocasys/rug/vak/viewtutor?tutor=1934">dr.
